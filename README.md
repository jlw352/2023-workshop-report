# 2023 Workshop Report

## Introduction

Workshop took place July 23rd-27th 2023 at Cornell University, hosted by [CHESS](https://www.chess.cornell.edu/macchess) and [DIALS](https://dials.github.io/). The workshop aim was to work out where we are as a community and where we are going.

## Attendees

TODO fill in attendees here:
- Graeme Winter
- Derek Mendez

Others will follow as we have their permission to include them in the workshop report.

## Developer Session Reports

## User Sesion Reports

The user workshop had eight sessions:

- [Bringing serial into the routine](./01-routine-serial/README.md)
- [Comparing and contrasting X-FEL and synchrotron serial crystallography](./02-xfel-synchrotron/README.md)
- [Synthesising data for reposition](./03-deposition/README.md)
- [Missing methods for data integration and scaling](./04-missing-integration-scaling/README.md)
- [What we are missing in methods for serial crystallography](./05-missing-serial-methods/README.md)
- [What we can learn from chemical crystallography](./06-learn-chemical-crystallography/README.md)
- [Modelling photons for serial crystallography](./07-modelling-photons/README.md)
- [What is stopping us from publishing?](./08-stopping-publishing/README.md)

## Executive Summary of Report

The [executive summary](./executive-summary/README.md) of the workshop is there to highlight the top-level outcomes, with the intention to be able to include these as e.g. an appendix in a grant application.

## Workshop Formal Report

The [formal workshop report](./report/README.md) should ultimately be published e.g. in [IUCrJ](https://journals.iucr.org/m/) with the intention of presenting the views of those who took part in the workshop. This should be an experimental particle physics type report where we have everyone involved in alphabetical order as an author.
